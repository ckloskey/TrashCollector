# TrashCollector
ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Application

User Stories:

As a developer, I want to implement Roles for this application (ASP.NET roles).

As an anonymous user, I want to be able to enter my information and sign up, so I can start receiving regular trash pickups.

As a customer:
- I want to be able to select or change my weekly pickup day. 
- I want to be able to request an extra, one-time pickup for a specific date of my choice.
- I want an easy way to see how much I owe this month for the pickups I did get so I can budget accordingly.

As an Employee:
- I want my default view to be a list of today’s trash pickups in my area (determined by the employee’s zip code).
- I want to be able to filter customers in my pickup area by a particular day of the week to see who gets a pickup for the day selected.
- I want to be able to confirm that I have completed a pickup.
- I want all confirmed pickups to have a charge applied to the customer.
- I want to be able to select a customer profile and see their address with a pin on a map (Google Maps API).
